# Module 18 Weekly Challenge - E-Commerce Back-End [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)



## Description



## Installation

Download the repository files to your computer, and extract the zipped files to a dedicated folder.

## Requirements

- Node; https://nodejs.org/en

## Usage 

Navigate to the repository a git bash shell (or equivalent), and type "npm install" to install the application's dependencies. If you want the database to be seeded with some sample information, then you can also type "npm run seed" before running the server.js file.

Next, open a program such as Insomnia to interact with the server. The PORT is set to default to 3001, so all requests will be made to "http://localhost:3001/". From here, all routes for interacting with the backend involve "/api", followed by the model you want to interact with;

## Demo

See a video demonstrating the application's functionality [here]()
